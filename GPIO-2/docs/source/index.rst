   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Example GPIO Skill
=============================

This Example show show to use Picroft GPIO pins in your skills directly using RPi.GPIO module for accessing the GPIO pins.  This will run on non-RPi or PC based mycroft installs only as demonstration.  The RPi.GPIO import will fail and be ignored so no GPIO will work.  You will see changes from Mycroft though.
